# Exoplanet Detection using Lightkurve in a Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to detect exoplanets using the `lightkurve` package. We focus on analyzing the light curves of the following stars:

- **KIC 8462852**: Also known as Tabby's Star or Boyajian's Star, it is famous for its unusual light fluctuations.
- **KIC 6922244**: A star observed by the Kepler mission.
- **Pi Mensae**: A star that hosts at least one known exoplanet.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following Python packages installed:

- `lightkurve`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `astropy`
- `seaborn` (optional, for enhanced plotting aesthetics)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install lightkurve matplotlib numpy astropy seaborn
